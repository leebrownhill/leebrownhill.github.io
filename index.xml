      <description>&lt;br&gt; This year I attended SQLBits 2025, which is not exactly unusual for me. What was unusual, however, was that I was one of the many helpers at the event. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The conference was held at ExCeL London and was  bigger, brighter and more jam-packed with speakers than ever before&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt; Within the professional world, I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in putting oneself in uncomfortable, but healthy, situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Uncomfortable situations are where development and growth occur.&#xA;Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s nice knowing exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re doing some days, and you complete tasks so easily&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt; As part of Redgate SQL Test, you get SQLCop &lt;br&gt; (although the tests themselves are freely available to use). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;SQLCop is a set of over 100 open-source tests for your databases. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The tests were originally maintained by George Mastros but are now managed by Redgate Software</description>

      <description>&lt;BR&gt; Some of the defaults in earlier versions of SQL Server are less than ideal, particularly Cost Threshold For Parallelism (CTFP) and Max Degree Of Parallelism (MAXDOP).&#xA;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&#xA;Sure, things have improved in later versions. For example, since SQL Server 2019 the installer now prompts you to change MAXDOP. However, its still a problem for many workloads&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in performance tuning is the importance of breaking queries tasks into smaller, more manageable sections.&#xA;Who knew? The experts were right all along when they said, &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re confused by the query, SQL probably is too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back friends!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the past &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leebrownhill.com/tags/tsql/&#34;&gt;four posts&lt;/a&gt;, we have covered the fundamental concepts regarding tSQLt, look at how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come!.&#xA;So far, everything we have done has been within SSMS using the open source framework that is tSQLt.&#xA;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at some third party tooling available, harnessing the power of tSQLt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re back once again, with another instalment of the tSQLt series. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying it so far. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blast getting back into this topic.&#xA;In the last post, we covered one of the many useful features of tSQLt, the Fake Function option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking this further, in today&amp;rsquo;s post, I want to cover the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tsqlt.org/user-guide/isolating-dependencies/spyprocedure/&#34;&gt;Spy Procedure&lt;/a&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unit Testing Experts!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leebrownhill.com/posts/1_sqlunittestingpart1/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, we went through what unit testing is, at least when discussing it in the context of SQL Server. In addition to that, we discussed what benefits using the open-source framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://tsqlt.org/&#34;&gt;tSQLt&lt;/a&gt; can bring.&#xA;Of course, you have studied that post diligently and now we&amp;rsquo;re all unit testing experts, right? &amp;hellip; hello?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--&#xA;### Unit...what now?&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unit&amp;hellip;what now?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other practitioners of code-slinging, such as .NET folks, have been unit testing their code for many moons now. We SQL folks, however, rarely seem to do this, at least in my experience.&#xA;Several job roles ago, I had to use unit testing on a daily basis. It was heavily integrated into our workflow via the CI/CD pipelines we used&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lee Brownhill is a SQL Server DBA with more years of experience than he cares to admit.&#xA;Currently, he works as a Principal Cloud DBA at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudrede.com/&#34;&gt;Cloud Rede&lt;/a&gt;, helping clients optimise their SQL workloads in both Azure and AWS. His passion lies in optimisation and automation within SQL Server, and he confesses that he will never tire of making things run faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His journey in IT began many moons ago in IT support, where he quickly became fascinated with his organisation’s SQL Server.&#xA;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to realise that he wanted to work with SQL Server and so, eventually started his journey as a Production DBA at a SaaS financial company. Realising he had a knack for making systems more efficient, he transitioned to a Developer DBA role, bridging the gap between Infrastructure DBAs and developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
