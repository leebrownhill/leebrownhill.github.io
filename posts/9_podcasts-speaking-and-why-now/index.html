<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Within the professional world, I&rsquo;m a firm believer in putting oneself in uncomfortable, but healthy, situations. <br> Uncomfortable situations are where development and growth occur.
Sure, it&rsquo;s nice knowing exactly what you&rsquo;re doing some days, and you complete tasks so easily you could do them with your eyes closed - I get it, and I am exactly the same at times. <br>
However, do that for too long dear reader and you risk becoming as stagnant as last year&rsquo;s resolutions. This - at least - is how I feel.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="podcast-appearances">Podcast Appearances</h3>
<p>Recently I have taken some of my own medicine by putting myself in a situation or two where I hope to learn and grow. I appeared on not just one, but two data platform shows!</p>
<p>First up was the <a href="https://www.sqlsquared.co.uk">SQL_Squared</a> show where I sat with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-morgan-gumm-450751133/">David</a> for just under an hour and talked all things data. <br></p>
<p>Between you, me, and the gatepost, I was a little nervous - but much to my surprise I really enjoyed it! Watching back now, sure I did a couple of goofy, wince-inducing things, but overall I was pleasantly surprised by how well I did. Additionally, may I be so bold as to say I had&hellip;fun? I think so.</p>
<p>David was a gracious host and his passion for data is rather infectious. He puts a serious amount of work into this show and community so do please go support him.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/d0gTWeTgASA?si=tFsEEcMQjki0JNoI"> <img src="/posts/post_images/SS.png" alt="SQL Squared Podcast Thumbnail"> </a></p>
<br>
<p>Next up, I appeared on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@findingdatafriends">Finding Data Friends</a> show. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpomfret/">Jess Pomfret</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/weissmanben/">Ben Weissman</a> are the well-known hosts for this one and they couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer.
Any show where I can go talk about data and food is always going to get my attention.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jess and Ben for the chat - we had such fun.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3 id="why-im-doing-this">Why I&rsquo;m Doing This</h3>
<p>Well, apart from the aforementioned nonsense about making oneself uncomfortable in order to develop (it&rsquo;s not nonsense), I want to get better at speaking publicly about data and tech.
It&rsquo;s been something on the to-do list for a while now and so, I made a small, humble start on that journey.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have been on this planet now for more years than I care to admit, along the way I have picked up a <strong>LOT</strong> of real-world experience and insight regarding the Microsoft Data Platform.</p>
<p>I believe I have knowledge to share with the data community which could help others.  And let&rsquo;s face it, the data community is the best of the best when it comes to tech communities.
This year, I made a vow to give back to that incredible community that has given me so much over the years. Speaking is simply one of the avenues which I feel I can give back.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="what-the-future-holds">What the future holds</h3>
<p>How far does this journey go? I haven&rsquo;t a clue at the moment. But what I do know is that I have had such a great time doing the two podcasts and want to do more.
So much so that I’ve already been following up on a few leads, making sure they know I’m available if they ever want to talk about data.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe soon I&rsquo;ll even get brave enough to start submitting some sessions to the next big conference!</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks for reading.
