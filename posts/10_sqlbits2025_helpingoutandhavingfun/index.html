<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This year I attended <a href="https://sqlbits.com/">SQLBits 2025</a>, which is not exactly unusual for me. What was unusual, however, was that I was one of the many helpers at the event.
The conference was held at ExCeL London and was bigger, brighter, and more jam-packed with speakers than ever before.
So, I donned that famous orange T-shirt, got stuck in, made friends, and helped (albeit in a small way) to deliver the amazing event that is SQLBits.</p>
<p>It was my first time volunteering. I nearly made it in 2024 but had to back out at the last minute due to personal reasons. This year, I was determined to get the most out of the experience. I was there for just two days (Thursday and Friday) and, to be honest, my legs were grateful! It&rsquo;s a long day on your feet, and doing it back-to-back really highlighted just how <em>tragically</em> unfit I am.</p>
<p>The helpers at these events are all volunteers and WORK THEIR SOCKS OFF.
Massive respect to those who do the full four days - you are the true stars, and I salute you ðŸ«¡</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="why-i-volunteered">Why I Volunteered</h3>
<p>I volunteered to help at SQLBits 2025 for several reasons.
I wanted to support the data community - Iâ€™ve spoken before about how important supporting the data community is to me, and this is yet another opportunity to give back.
Next, I wanted to network and expand my circle of data friends. I&rsquo;ve realised the true power of networking in the past couple of years; itâ€™s opened doors that wouldâ€™ve otherwise been out of reach.
Finally, I thought it would be a fun experience (and I was absolutely right!). From the start, it was full of energy, learning, and great conversations, I couldnâ€™t have asked for better!</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="event-highlights">Event Highlights</h3>
<p>There were many highlights for me this year - more than usual, in fact.</p>
<p>I met so many new people and definitely intend to stay in touch with some. The helper team were incredibly welcoming - I felt like part of the group right away, and for that, Iâ€™m truly grateful.
I would like to give some special shoutouts, however. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steph-martin-38907614/">Steph Martin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-frazer/">Simon Frazer</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevriley/">Kevan Riley</a>, <a href="https://sessionize.com/alex-travis-dumitrache-ward/">Alex Dumitrache-Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardswinbank/">Richard Swinbank</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickappleby/">Nick Appleby</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-ellis-ab76041/">Lee Ellis</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bettinaellisklar/">Bettina Ellis-Klar</a>.</p>
<p>Picking a single favourite session is tough (there were so many standouts) but one that really stuck with me was Erin Stellatoâ€™s session on SSMS 21. She delivered the content with such clarity and flair. Bravo, Erin!
The breadth of sessions on at SQLBits is always impressive. There were some true stars of the data world there this year.</p>
<p>I got to see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobwardms/">Bob Ward</a> present, which was a first for me, a true SQL legend:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinstellato/">Erin Stellato</a>&rsquo;s style of delivery was awesome - such a succinct speaker:</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I also got to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentozar/">Brent Ozar</a> - which was very cool! I had a brief chat with Brent and took the chance to thank him for all the content heâ€™s created over the years. Itâ€™s had a huge impact on my knowledge and career. Thanks, Brent!</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>If you know me at all, you&rsquo;ll probably know that &rsquo;every day is a school day&rsquo; and whilst travelling home a thought stuck with me. What really hit home during my time at SQLBits was that itâ€™s all about the people - helpers, speakers, and attendees alike. It sounds trite, but it&rsquo;s true.
The real lesson wasnâ€™t technical at all; it was something more abstract, more human.</p>
<p>In the past, I used to hold data platform experts high up on a pedestal - like they were magical, mythical beings rather than regular people.</p>
<p>But guess what, folks? Theyâ€™re just normal people like you and me. Realising that made their achievements feel both more impressive and more attainable - itâ€™s not about being born brilliant, itâ€™s about showing up and putting in the time.</p>
<p>Sure, theyâ€™re incredibly knowledgeable and have a lifetime of experience to draw on, but at the end of the day, theyâ€™re still just people.
What sets them apart is the time theyâ€™ve invested - learning, studying, and honing their skills to a razor-sharp edge. A real inspiration.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Would I do it again? Hell yes, I would! I canâ€™t wait to do it all over again. It was one of the best experiences Iâ€™ve had within the data community, and Iâ€™m already itching to sign up for SQLBits 2026!</p>
<p>If this sounds like something youâ€™d enjoy, I wholeheartedly encourage you to get involved next year - itâ€™s such a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
